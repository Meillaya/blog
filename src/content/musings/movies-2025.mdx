I've been watching quite a few movies lately. Here's what I've seen so far in 2025:


Finally got around to watching this masterpiece. A haunting portrayal of the brilliant but tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer and the moral weight of scientific discovery. Cillian Murphy delivers a career-defining performance.

A bizarre and beautiful film that defies easy categorization. Emma Stone is phenomenal as Bella Baxter. The art direction and costume design create a surreal Victorian world that needs to be seen to be believed.
