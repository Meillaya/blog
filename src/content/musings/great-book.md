My first foray into the incredible writing of Lispector. A self-reflective, existentialist examination of  identity, existence and the oftentimes tragedy of being alive.

When I think of masterpieces of Russian literature, I often think of Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Anna Karenina, as well as Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, and The Brothers Karamazov. I also think of Alexander Pushkin’s epic poem Eugene Onegin, Ivan Turgenev’s A Hunter’s Sketches, Fathers and Sons, First Love and Faust, Mikhail Lermontov’s A Hero of Our Time, Anton Chekhov’s plays and short stories – “The Three Sisters,” “Uncle Vanya,” and “The Cherry Orchard” – and Nicholai Gogol’s Dead Souls. During the period of Soviet oppression, there are such writers as Boris Pasternak who wrote Dr. Zhivago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote Cancer Ward, The Gulag Archipelago, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, August 1914, and March 1917. And then there is Mikhail Bulgakov, the author of noteworthy plays, and his masterpiece The Master and Margarita, written between 1928 and 1940, and published in 1966 and 1967.  

I read the Penguin Classic Deluxe Edition, translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, with an Introduction by Richard Pevear and a Foreword by Boris Fishman.  
You will discover that Bulgakov has infused The Master and Margarita with the political satire of the Soviet regime, and with interesting and fantastical characters. Moreover, the genre is not only political satire, but a fantasy, filled with allegories, and literary allusions.  
The fantasy is about the Devil (Woland) who arrives in modern-day Moscow with his henchmen – Koroviev, his valet, Azazello, his hit man, Hella, a female vampire, and Behemoth, a large black cat. They all possess supernatural powers and create chaos in their wake. Part of the chaos is slapstick comedy and quite hilarious, but other parts are quite serious, a commentary or satire on Soviet oppression, resulting in murder. For instance, the death of Mikhail Berlioz, the head of a writer’s union, after meeting Woland at Patriarch Ponds, where they sit on a bench and converse, is unexpected. From that moment onward, the chaos becomes more profound and alarming. This is evident at Woland’s séance at the Variety Theater, the shenanigans at Berlioz’s summer restaurant – The House of Griboedov - on Griboedov Street, and at Berlioz’s apartment, number 50, on Sadovaya Street. All three are primary locations where fantastical, supernatural, and black magical phenomena take place. Especially, at Berlioz’s much sought-after apartment, where Woland and his henchmen have taken up temporary residence.  
Margarita enters in book two, and she is a beauty, who is more than willing to do anything for her lover, the Master, who has authored a book about Pontius Pilate, the fifth procurator of Judea, and the passion and crucifixion of Jesus (Jeshua, Ha-Nozri), on Bald Mountain (Golgotha). Throughout the book, Bulgakov returns to the Master’s story, the Pontius Pilate story, (which is a story within a story) every now and again. You will find the conversation between Jesus and Pilate to be captivating and interesting, especially if you compare them to the Gospels of Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John. The story engenders strong emotions of sadness and guilt, analogous to what the secret police, and what others, might have felt later, after the downfall of the Soviet regime.  
For the sake of the Master, her lover, who the authorities locked away in room 118 in a psychiatric clinic, Margarita agrees to become a witch, temporarily, and accompany Woland and his retinue to a Devilish Ball. Afterwards, Woland grants her a wish, reuniting her and her lover in their basement apartment, where he spent years earlier writing the Pontius Pilate story.  
As Woland and his henchmen depart Moscow, with Margarita and the Master, riding strong steeds into the moonlight, and as Pontius Pilate simultaneously walks into the moonlight in Ivan Nikolaevich’s dream, you cannot help but feel the sadness and nostalgia of the penultimate and last chapter of the book. “Forgiveness and Eternal Refuge,” and the “Epilogue” could easily bring you to tears, as if someone - the regime, Pontius Pilate - were indeed asking for forgiveness. Walking into the moonlight, Pilate says to his companion, “Gods, gods…tell me it never happened! I implore you, tell me, it never happened!” And his walking companion replies, “Well, of course it never happened…you imagined it.” He swears to it, and Pilates says, “I need nothing more,” ending the story with profound emotions of denial and guilt. And thus ends Bulgakov’s political satire and masterpiece.  
Mikhail Bulgakov’s novel The Master and Margarita exceeded all my expectations. You will find this book to be enlightening, educational, and entertaining. It is a masterpiece, and thus, I highly recommend this book to all readers.



I have very mixed feelings writing a review of The Master and the Margarita. If you speak with practically any Russian who has graduated college in Russia, they have read the novel, and they smile when you mention it. And the story behind the novel is perhaps just as important as the novel itself. Bulgakov wrote it between 1928 and 1940 during the height of Stalin's Reign of Terror, and it wasn't until 1966 that it was published, and when it was published, it went viral.  
  
Furthermore, Bulgakov's family and Bulgakov himself had supported the anti-Bolshevik White Army during the Civil War and he continued to write satires of the existing regime. He should have been erased, but for some God-only-knows reason Stalin liked him, so he lived. Bulgakov even wrote Stalin that he wanted to get out of the USSR, and lived.  
  
The novel itself is not only hard for a non-Russian speaker to read because of the difficulty in following the difficult Russian names and nicknames (though with some help and effort you can deal with this), but in the translation there are a lot of word plays that are lost, especially in people names. Additionally, many of the places and characters and organizations and occurrences are closely based on 1920s-1930s early Soviet life. This is a large part of the novel and is also all lost to all but the most knowledgeable modern reader.  
  
Nevertheless, Pevear and Volokhonsky's introduction and frequent footnotes (easily accessed on the Kindle version) at least give the reader a feeling for what they are missing. For instance, knowing about the struggles the early Soviet Republic had trying to control currency is essential to be able to laugh at the scenes where money falls from the ceiling of the theater, only to change to useless pieces of paper the next day. Also, knowing about the severe housing shortage in Moscow following the Bolshevik take over makes it funny when the uncle of the deceased poet comes to Moscow not to participate in the funeral, but to lay claim to the deceased's empty apartment unit.  
  
The scene where the main character goes for a swim (?to save someone from drowning) only to have his clothes stolen and switched out for clowns clothing....and then have this guy investigated by a seemingly relatively well-meaning psychiatrist (Dr. Stravinsky) for running around town all dressed up as a clown is funny on many levels.  
  
Admittedly, this is the second time I read this book, the first time about 7 years ago, and I didn't get much out of it then. Since then, I have read a fair deal of late Russian and Soviet history, especially Figes (see all my reviews of him, he's super fantastic), so when I read M & M this time, it made a lot more sense and I appreciated the satire and humor much more. There is a gradesaver.com Cliff's Notes style study guide with chapter summaries, that I found helpful as I read along. Laura Weeks also has a short paperback on M & M. I found the introduction very interesting regarding the background, though the later chapters were beyond my level of interest.  
  
Good luck and I hope you appreciate the book.
