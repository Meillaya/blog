  title="The Hour of the Star"
  author="Clarice Lispector"
  rating={5}

  <div slot="intro">
    My first foray into the incredible writing of Lispector. A self-reflective, existentialist examination of identity, existence and the oftentimes tragedy of being alive.
     The novel follows Macabéa, a poor, uneducated girl from Northeast Brazil who moves to Rio de Janeiro. Through her story, Lispector explores themes of poverty, alienation, and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent world.
  
  What makes this work particularly fascinating is Lispector's narrative approach, where the narrator (Rodrigo S.M.) constantly interrupts the story to reflect on his own role in creating Macabéa's tale. This meta-fictional element adds layers of complexity to what might otherwise be a simple story.
  
  Despite its brevity, this novel contains profound insights into the human condition that continue to resonate long after the final page.

  title="Love"
  author="Hanne Ørstavik"
  rating={5}

  <div slot="intro">
It's a novel about temperature in the sense that it is clear that Ørstavik is preoccupied with these precipices between coldness and warmth, and she brings this to life through her focus on sensory detail—the brush of a dressing gown string down a thigh, scents of leather jackets, deodorant, the deafening volume of TV sets and live music; this coupled with the anatomical detail offered to other characters—backs, arms, teeth, eyeballs—all contribute to building up the characters existing in a physical space and, therefore, vulnerable to real physical danger. And because of this, you feel the transitions between cold and warmth deeply, each warming scene giving us a breath of life, a relief, and thus temperature gains its metaphorical significance without it having to be spelled out for us—the warm describing the life-affirming nature of both romantic and familial love, and the cold being that absence.
  </div>

The other thing Ørstavik pulls off so effectively is this dreamlike sense of minimalism which is at the same time detached and dizzying. The novella follows both Jon and Vibeke's perspective from third-person close perspective, and the transition between perspectives is never announced, sometimes changing paragraph to paragraph, despite the two characters being in different places—it can take a moment to reorient oneself. The other dizzying aspect is this dramatic irony that pervades throughout—despite knowing both characters may be in physical peril, we are given the story from their immediate perspective and voice. Vibeke is focused on her own presentation, her sensuality, and inanities such as decoration and her job. Jon's perspective is naturally of a child, and his sense of confusion and childlike optimism is both beautiful and heartbreaking. Back and forth we go, the reader naturally seeking that rising 'objective' sense, only to realise that there is nothing the reader can do to save these characters from their impending fates.

Love and warmth are interchangeable in this story. Vibeke sees warmth in her romantic interest, a fairground worker. Jon sees it in other families, seeing the 'warmth and softness' of others. The overall effect is a very touching examination of what we will do for love, what we will sacrifice and what we can lose with its absence.
