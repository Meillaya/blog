# Image Customization with MDX

With MDX files, you have much more control over image customization compared to standard Markdown.

## Default Markdown Syntax

Here's the standard Markdown syntax for images:

![The Hour of The Star book cover](/images/the-hour-of-the-star.jpeg)

## Enhanced Images with the Image Component

Here's how to use the Astro Image component for enhanced control:

<Image 
  src={bookCover} 
  alt="The Hour of The Star book cover" 
  width={300} 
  height={450}
/>

## Images with Custom Styling

You can also add custom styling to your images:

<Image 
  src={bookCover} 
  alt="The Hour of The Star book cover" 
  width={300} 
  height={450}
  style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);"
/>

## Images with Figure and Caption

<figure>
  <Image 
    src={bookCover} 
    alt="The Hour of The Star book cover" 
    width={300} 
    height={450}
  />
  <figcaption>The Hour of The Star by Clarice Lispector</figcaption>
</figure>

## Remote Images

You can also use remote images:

<Image 
  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544947950-fa07a98d237f?q=80&w=1000"
  alt="Remote image example" 
  width={500} 
  height={300}
/>

## Benefits of Using the Image Component

- Automatic optimization for different screen sizes
- Lazy loading for better performance
- WebP format conversion for smaller file sizes
- Proper sizing and aspect ratio maintenance
- Prevents layout shifts with width and height attributes
