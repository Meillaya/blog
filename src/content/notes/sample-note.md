# Sample Note

This is a sample note to test the notes system. Notes are meant to be shorter, more informal thoughts and observations.

## Quick Thoughts

- Notes are different from essays in that they're more casual
- They can be used for quick observations
- Perfect for documenting ideas that don't need a full essay format

This system allows for both structured essays and quick notes to coexist on the same blog.
