title: "Optimizing Neural Network Performance"
description: "Numpy can multiply two 1024x1024 matrices on a 4-core Intel CPU in ~8ms. This is incredibly fast, considering this boils down to 18 FLOPs / core / cycle, with a cycle taking a third of a nanosecond. Numpy does this using a highly optimized BLAS implementation."
