title: "Constructing and Optimizing a C Compiler in Rust"
description: "Building a compiler in Rust involves parsing source code into an AST, performing semantic analysis, and generating optimized machine code through techniques like constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop unrolling. The optimization phase transforms the intermediate representation to produce faster executables while preserving program behavior"
