# Day 2: Lexical Analysis Implementation

## Today's Focus
- Implemented basic lexer functionality
- Continued studying compiler theory
- Worked on token handling mechanisms

## What I Learned
Building upon yesterday's foundation, I made progress in several areas:

1. **Lexer Implementation**
   - Created basic token structure
   - Implemented character stream handling
   - Added support for basic lexemes

2. **Compiler Theory**
   - Studied different parsing approaches
   - Learned about regular expressions in compiler context
   - Researched error handling strategies

3. **Code Organization**
   - Established project structure
   - Set up unit testing framework
   - Created documentation framework

## Challenges
- Handling edge cases in lexical analysis
- Designing flexible token structures
- Balancing between features and complexity

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Implement more token types
- Add error recovery mechanisms
- Start planning parser implementation

## Resources Used
- Compiler design documentation
- Online lexer implementation examples
- Testing framework documentation
