# Day 1: The Beginning

## Today's Focus
- Set up development environment for compiler project
- Started reading "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom
- Reviewed basic C programming concepts

## What I Learned
Today marked the beginning of my journey back to CS fundamentals. I focused on:

1. **Development Environment**
   - Configured Neovim for C/Rust development
   - Set up necessary debugging tools
   - Organized project structure

2. **Compiler Basics**
   - Reviewed lexical analysis concepts
   - Started planning the compiler architecture
   - Studied token types and lexeme handling

3. **C Programming Review**
   - Refreshed memory on pointers and memory management
   - Practiced with basic data structures
   - Reviewed file I/O operations

## Challenges
- Getting comfortable again with C's memory management
- Understanding the initial compiler architecture decisions
- Balancing between reading theory and practical implementation

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Start implementing the lexer
- Continue reading Chapter 2 of "Crafting Interpreters"
- Begin working on token structure implementation

## Resources Used
- "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom
- Various online C programming references
- Compiler design documentation
